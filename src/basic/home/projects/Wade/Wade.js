                              Streamers can either stream indirectly to Twitch, Facebook or Youtube then the streams will be replayed on LeftistMediaGroup.com or they can stream directly to the LMG server to then be displayed on the website show the world what is going on
                              Streamers streaming indirectly get all the credit for their work as each stream is clearly labeled and linked to owner
                              Streamers streaming via the (open source) LMG app can choose to be anonymous.

                              Security members will be the front line of defence between the police or other bad actors such as the proud boys and other white supremacists and the main group of protestors. They will train virtually and their main goal is to keep other protestors safe from police violence. Tactics are mainly consolidated from the Hong Kong protests like using umbrellas and homemade shields to form a shield wall and using thermoses and leaf blowers to neutralize tear gas. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactics_and_methods_surrounding_the_2019%E2%80%9320_Hong_Kong_protests)
                              Security will scout for police along the march route and will direct the flow of the protest to avoid police if possible and prevent kettling.
